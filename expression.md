day crew, night crew

There’s no use crying over spilt milk.

Spilt water is hard to recover.

The early bird gets the worm.

A fast foot is first to climb

Misery loves company.

    Patients with similar conditions empathise with each other.

We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it.

What goes around, comes around.

As you sow a melon, so you shall reap one.

As you sow a bean, so you shall reap one.

A daughter-in-law who suffers will one day become a mother-in-law.

Like father, like son.

A friend in need is a friend indeed.

    Inadversity, true feelings are revealed.

No pain, no gain; nothing ventured, nothing gained.

Don’t put off until tomorrow what can be done today.

If you want something done well, do it yourself.

Once bitten, twice shy.

All good things come to an end.

When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

When it rains, it pours.

Two heads are better than one.

Easy come, easy go.

There’s more than one way to skin a cat.

Practice makes perfect.
