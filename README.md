# Ark Native English

I will use this GitHub pages to learn Native English

Why you can understand Ma Yun, but you cannot understand what native speaker say? 
    You are not familier with the sound block from native speakers.
       also the native expression, you are not familiar, you only familiar to Ma Yun's translation english expression, in Chinese it is called 用词
So we need to learn native expression, memorize native sound block, and then build the link between sound block to meaning directly.  


To speak like a native, we don't have to be very painful, we just need to be like a primary school student. That's enough. The effort is not too much to get this level. Finally we need to be alble to listen English book when doing homework, running, etc. We can learn new things in English while having some distraction there. We don't have to be very serious to listen something instead.


Listen, memorize, recall, speak
read, compose, speak

No translation at all
