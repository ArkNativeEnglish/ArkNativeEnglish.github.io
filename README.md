I will use this GitHub pages to learn Native English

Listen, memorize, recall, speak
read, compose, speak

No translation at all

    Weekends, learn at libraries,  quiet, clean, and take a coffee, look out of the window, relex

Note down some native expression here: <https://arknativeenglish.github.io/expression.md>

Google: define xxx and then check the context, picture to understand what the new word means
